<h1>Save on Your water Bills<br/></h1>
Do you know how much you spend on your water bills each month? You can save up when you know what you spend on the most. 
Use our calculator to save up on bills and also find out how many donuts or coffee you can buy with the money saved. Who doesn't love coffee and donuts!! Right ?!
We aim to save a minimum of 155L per person per day.
